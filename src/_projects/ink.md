      Microsoft pioneered pen computing three decades ago. The release of
      Windows 10 reaffirmed their commitment to touch and gesture oriented
      operating systems but no term existed to communicate or promote the added
      functionality offered by pen technology. Windows Ink captures the essence
      of the experience and suggests the range of capabilities of pen computing
      by repurposing a familiar term in an unfamiliar space.

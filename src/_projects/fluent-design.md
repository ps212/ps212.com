      The word fluent is a metaphor for eloquence and a befitting name for
      Microsoftâ€™s most eloquent design system yet. Introducing Fluent Design:
      The successor to the more static Microsoft Design Language 2, the new
      Fluent Design system focuses on the fluent commingling of five
      foundational elements: light, depth, motion, material, and scale to create
      beautiful, intuitive experiences across Windows 10 devices.

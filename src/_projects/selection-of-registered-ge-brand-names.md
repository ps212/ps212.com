      **GE Durathon**

      GE reached out to PS212 to develop a new brand name for their industry changing, long-life, industrial battery. The team coined the name Durathon from the real words durability and marathon. The new term immediately communicates two of the product’s core attributes—extended life and durability.

      **GE WattStation**

      GE was seeking a brand name that was literal and engaging for their line of consumer charging stations. WattStation uses older world terms as a means of delivering that familiarity. When paired with such forward looking products this name creates conversation worthy tension.

      **GE GeoSpring**

      GE Appliances successfully engineered an intelligent water heater capable of using up to 62% less energy than previous generations. The notable innovation was, in part, the device’s ability to use warm ambient air to supplement traditional heating elements.

      PS212 created the GeoSpring name which is a reference to the product’s function—warm water— and benefit—environmental sensitivity.​

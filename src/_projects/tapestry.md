      Formerly Coach Inc., Tapestry is the new name for the holding company that
      houses the Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands. In the name
      Tapestry we found the perfect metaphor for the companyâ€™s transformation
      into a house of wonderful brands with room to grow. Tapestry connotes
      color, stories, creativity and craftsmanship. It expresses the diversity
      and collaborative nature of the company culture as well as its shared
      values of being optimistic, innovative and inclusive.

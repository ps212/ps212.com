      With over a 100-year global legacy, Catholic Medical Mission Board partnered with PS212 and HA Roth Consulting to refresh their brand through a new name, brand positioning platform and visual identity, to make it more representative of the agile, action-oriented, global work they are currently providing to women, children and their communities. PS212 collaborated closely with the CMMB executive team and Board to revitalize their Mission, Vision and Values, which became the foundation of a dynamic new brand positioning statement we also created on the organization’s behalf. With this strong, credible foundation, which proudly celebrates CMMB’s Catholic heritage, collaborative global partnerships and their principled belief that every human life is valued as our guide, we were then asked to create a compelling visual identity.

      The new visual identity speaks directly to their programmatic mission. The signature can be read as an ampersand, speaking to partnership and community. The logo can also be read as an abstract illustration of a mother cradling a child, communicating compassion, love and those who most benefit from CMMB’s work. The Madonna and child arrangement also serves as a reference to the organization’s Catholic heritage. The system uses a bright color palette, supergraphic shapes inspired by the logo and bold photography.​

      Etsy created their first new market since 2005 and we named it Etsy
      Studio: A new market designed exclusively for buying and selling craft
      supplies and tools.&nbsp; We decided on the word studio for its rich
      associations with art, creativity and getting things done, as well as its
      ability, as a simple generic word, not to overshadow or seem disconnected
      from the Etsy brand. Sometimes the most practical, simple answer to a new
      name makes the greatest creative impact and the most strategic sense.

      GE Licensing was tasked with repositioning themselves to internal and external teams. The leadership team retained PS212 to establish their position, create a visual system to express that position, and re-launch the brand.

      Seeing opportunity where others do not served as the foundation for the group’s brand and culture. The building blocks visual system PS212 developed is a reflection of the Seeing Opportunity promise—tiles that can be arranged in unexpected ways.

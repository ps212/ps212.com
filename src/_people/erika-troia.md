Erika, a Psychology major from the University of Virginia, is fascinated by the implicit associations and perceptions we have to words and language, and how these factors inevitably affect our emotional engagement with a brand name.&nbsp;

Erika has a background in communication strategy, media planning, and name generation, honing the skills to construct and deliver language that effectively connects a brand to its consumer.&nbsp;

As a brand naming strategist, Erika has worked with agencies and clients in New York City and has developed thousands of names for companies, products and services across multiple industries including pharmaceutical, food and beverage, health and wellness, corporate non-profit, retail, and more. &nbsp;

As a student of improvisational comedy at the Peoples Improv Theater in New York City, she's adopted the theater's basic principle of supporting and expanding ideas and moving communication forward through the exploration of all viewpoints, as part of her strategic blueprint to the naming process.&nbsp;
